Version 3.4 - November 1994, by Franc,ois Pinard

* Charset HTML is new, it handles `&...;' sequences for Latin-1.
* Charset AtariST handling is more general, --list may be used with it.
* Charset ASCII-BS overstriking has been extended, mainly for German.
* Charset RFC1345 may be a goal, to debug or study RFC 1345 short names.
* Charset names have been revised.  Note that nextstep is now NeXT.
* Option --force (-f) is accepted, but does not yet protect reversibility.
* Option --quiet or --silent (-q) silences irreversible recoding messages.
* Option --known=PAIRS (-k) helps searching through recodings.
* Option --sequence=pipe (-p) does not fall back on -o anymore.
* Option --auto-check may narrow its study around one particular charset.
* An MSDOS port is available, check ftp.iro.umontreal.ca in pub/gnuish.
* Compilation should now succeed on OS/2 EMX.  Thanks to Kai Uwe Rommel.
* Program initialization is almost three times faster on average.
* Corrected reported bugs, added small improvements, some aesthetic.

Version 3.3 - December 1993, by Franc,ois Pinard

* Charsets atarist, ebcdic-ccc, ebcdic-ibm and nextstep have been added.
* Also, most RFC 1345 charsets and aliases are handled.  That's a bunch!
* Old ascii disappears because of RFC 1345's ascii, use ascii-bs instead.
* Old maci disappears because of RFC 1345's macintosh, use applemac instead.
* Charsets cccascii and cdcascii disappear, use ebcdic-ccc and ebcdic instead.
* Recoding between latin1, ibmpc and applemac is (almost) reversible.
* The texinfo documentation has been reorganized, this to be continued.
* Long options are accepted, charset names may be abbreviated.
* Option --list (-l) displays charsets, aliases and contents in many formats.
* Option --strict (-s) asks for stricter, non-reversible recodings.
* Option --graphics (-g) approximates ibmpc rulers with ASCII graphics.
* Option --header (-h) produces C source for many recoding tables.
* Option --auto-check (-a) reports about all possible recodings.
* Option --ignore (-x) prevents a charset from being selected.
* Execution has been sped up through step merging, hashing for charset names.
* Many various buglets have been eradicated, portability increased.
* Charsets may be edited out by modifying the Makefile only.
* Configuration is made through the use of an external config.h file.
