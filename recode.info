GNU `recode'
************

   `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.  When
exact transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
characters or fall back on approximations.  This program recognizes or
produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able to
transliterate files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character
sets are supported.

   The current `recode' release is 3.4.

What is the purpose of this program
***********************************

   This `recode' program has the purpose of converting files between
various character sets and usages.  When exact transliterations are not
possible, as it is often the case, the program may get rid of the
offending characters or fall back on approximations.

   Let us coin the term "charset" to represent, without distinction, a
character set "per se" or a particular usage of a character set.  This
program recognizes or produces around 150 such charsets.  Since it can
convert each charset to almost any other one, many thousands of
different conversions are possible.

   This tool pays special attention to superimposition of diacritics for
French representation.  This orientation is mostly historical, it does
not impair the usefulness, generality or extensibility of the program.

Overview of charsets
====================

   Recoding is currently possible between most of the charsets
described in RFC 1345.  *Note RFC 1345 charsets::.

   Recode also handles some charsets in more specialized ways.  These
are:

   * usual 7-bit ASCII: without any diacritics, or else: using
     backspace for overstriking; Unisys' ICON convention; TeX/LaTeX
     coding; easy French conventions for electronic mail;

   * 8-bit extensions to ASCII: ISO Latin-1, Atari ST code, IBM's code
     for the PC, Apple's code for the Macintosh, NeXT code;

   * 6-bit escaped ASCII based on CDC display code: 6/12 code from NOS;
     bang-bang code from Universit'e de Montr'eal;

   * non-ASCII codes: three flavors of EBCDIC.

   The recent introduction of RFC 1345 in GNU `recode' has brought with
it a few charsets having the functionality of older ones, but yet being
different in subtle ways.  The effects have not been fully investigated
yet, so for now, clashes are avoided, the old and new charsets are kept
well separate.  For example, wizards would be interested in comparing
the output of these two commands:

     recode -vh IBM-PC:Apple-Mac
     recode -vh IBM437:macintosh

The first command uses only charsets prior to RFC 1345 introduction.
Both methods give different recodings, the first also properly recodes
end of lines.  These differences are annoying, the fuzziness will have
to be explained and settle down one day.

Contributions and bug reports
=============================

   Even being the `recode' author and current maintainer, I am no
specialist in charset standards.  I only made `recode' along the years
to solve my own needs, but felt it was applicable for the needs of
others.  Some GNU people liked the program structure and suggested to
make it more widely available.  I rely on GNU users judgment for what
is best to be done next.

   Properly protecting GNU `recode' about possible copyright fights is
a pain for me and for contributors, but we cannot avoid addressing the
issue in the long run.  Besides, the Free Software Foundation, which
mandates the GNU project, is very sensible to this matter.  GNU
standards require that I be cautious before looking at copyrighted code.
The safest and simplest way for me is to gather ideas and reprogram them
anew, even if this might slow me down considerably.  For contributions
going beyond a few lines of code here and there, the FSF definitely
requires employer disclaimers and copyright assignments in writing.

   Many users contributed to GNU `recode' already, I am grateful to
them for their interest and involvement.  Some suggestions can be
integrated quickly while some others have to be delayed, I have to draw
a line somewhere when time comes to make a new release, about what would
go in it and what would go in the next.  Also, when you contribute
something to `recode', *please* explain what it is about.  Do not take
for granted that I know those charsets which are familiar to you.  Your
explanations could well find their way into this documentation, too.

   Mail suggestions, documentation errors and bug reports to
`bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu' or, if you prefer, directly to Francois
Pinard `pinard@iro.umontreal.ca'.  Do not be afraid to report details,
because this program is the mere aggregation of hundreds of details.

How to use this program
***********************

   The general format of the program call is one of:

     recode [OPTION]... [CHARSET]
     recode [OPTION]... [BEFORE]:[AFTER] [FILE]...

   The second form is the common case.  Each FILE will be read assuming
it is coded with charset BEFORE, it will be recoded over itself so to
use the charset AFTER.  If there is no such FILE, the program rather
acts as a filter and recode standard input to standard output.

   The available options are:

`-C'
`--copyright'
     Given this option, all other parameters and options are ignored.
     The program prints briefly the Copyright and copying conditions.
     See the file `COPYING' in the distribution for full statement of
     the Copyright and copying conditions.

`-a'
`--auto-check'
     In this special mode, `recode' diagnostics itself by analyzing
     connectivity of the various charsets and reporting on standard
     output.  No file will be recoded.

     There might be one non-option argument, in which case it is
     interpreted as a charset name, possibly abbreviated to any non
     ambiguous prefix.  `recode' will then study all recodings having
     the given charset as a starting or ending point.  If there is no
     such non-option argument, `recode' will study *all* possible
     recodings.

     For each possible pair of different charsets, it prints on standard
     output how many single steps are needed for achieving the recoding
     and how many can be saved by step merging.  If a recoding cannot
     be done, the word `UNACHIEVABLE' is printed instead.  However,
     this special line is completely suppressed if option `-x'
     specified some charset to ignore.

     The option `-hNAME' affects the resulting output, because there
     are more merging rules when this option is in effect.  Other
     options affect the result: `-d', `-g' and, notably, `-s'.

     There was a time, in GNU `recode' development, when this option was
     reasonably interesting.  With the greater number of handled
     charsets, it became inordinately slow, taking on the order of one
     hour of wall clock time, while generating a great deal of output.
     This option is not practical anymore when used without a charset
     parameter.  However, it can be made slightly more usable, together
     with option `-x.', which effectively disables most RFC 1345
     charsets from the report.

`-c'
`--colons'
     With `Texte' Easy French conventions, use the column `:' instead
     of the double-quote `"' for marking diaeresis.  *Note Texte::.

`-d'
`--diacritics'
     While converting to or from one of `HTML' or `LaTeX' charset,
     limit conversion to diacritics only.  This is particularly useful
     when people write what would be valid `HTML', TeX or LaTeX files,
     if only they were using provided sequences for applying diacritics
     instead of using the diacriticized characters directly from the
     underlying character set.

     While converting to `HTML' or `LaTeX' charset, this option assumes
     that non-diacriticized special characters are properly coded or
     protected, so `recode' will transmit them literally.  While
     converting the other way, this option prevents all attempts at
     recognizing coded or protected versions of non-diacriticized
     special characters of the other charset.  *Note HTML::.  *Note
     LaTeX::.

`-f'
`--force'
     It is planned that some future version of `recode' will protect
     you against recoding a file irreversibly over itself.  However,
     please keep vividly in mind that this protection is not yet active
     in `recode'.  When the protection will be enforced, option `-f'
     will become mandatory for a file to be replaced by some recoding
     of its contents, if such conversion is loosing information.  For
     now, `recode' acts as if option `-f' was always selected.

     In preparation for the time this option will become mandatory, you
     may start using `-f' right away in scripts calling `recode', when
     you know this is the reasonnable thing to do.

`-g'
`--graphics'
     This option is only meaningful while getting *out* of the `IBM-PC'
     charset.  In this charset, characters 176 to 223 are used for
     constructing rulers and boxes, using simple or double horizontal or
     vertical lines.  This option forces the automatic selection of
     ASCII characters for approximating these rulers and boxes, at cost
     of making the transformation irreversible.  Option `-g' implies
     `-f'.

`-h[NAME]'
`--header[=NAME]'
     Instead of recoding files, `recode' writes a C source file on
     standard output and exits.  This source is meant to be included in
     a regular C program: its purpose is to declare and initialize an
     array, named NAME, which represents the requested recoding.  If
     NAME is not specified, then it defaults to `BEFORE_to_AFTER',
     where BEFORE is the starting charset and AFTER is the goal charset.

     Even if `recode' tries its best, this option does not always
     succeed in producing the requested C table.  It will however,
     provided the recoding can be internally represented by only one
     step after the optimization phase, and if this merged step conveys
     a one-to-one or a one-to-many explicit table.  But this is all
     fairly technical.  Better try and see!

     Beware that other options might affect the produced C tables,
     these are: `-d', `-g' and, particularly, `-s'.

`-i'
`--sequence=files'
     When the recoding requires a combination of two or more elementary
     recoding steps, this option forces many passes over the data, using
     intermediate files between passes.  This is the default behavior
     when files are recoded over themselves.  If this option is
     selected in filter mode, that is, when the program reads standard
     input and writes standard output, it might take longer for
     programs further down the pipe chain to start receiving some
     recoded data.

`-l[FORMAT]'
`--list[=FORMAT]'
     This option asks for information about all charsets, or about one
     particular charset.  No file will be recoded.

     If there is no non-option arguments, `recode' ignores the FORMAT
     value of the option, it writes a sorted list of charset names on
     standard output, one per line.  When a charset name have aliases
     or synonyms, they follow the true charset name on its line,
     presented in lexicographical order from left to right.  This list
     is over one hundred lines.  It is best used with `grep', as in:

          recode -l | grep greek

     There might be one non-option argument, in which case it is
     interpreted as a charset name, possibly abbreviated to any non
     ambiguous prefix.  This particular usage of the `-l' option is
     obeyed *only* for charsets having an RFC 1345 style internal
     description.  Even if most charsets have this property, some do
     not, then option `-l' cannot be used to detail these particular
     charsets.  For knowing if a particular charset can be listed this
     way, you should merely try and see if this works.  The FORMAT
     value of the option is a keyword from the following list.
     Keywords may be abbreviated by dropping suffix letters, and even
     reduced to the first letter only:

    `decimal'
          This format asks for the production on standard output of a
          concise tabular display of the charset, in which character
          code values are expressed in decimal.

    `octal'
          This format uses octal instead of decimal in the concise
          tabular display of the charset.

    `hexadecimal'
          This format uses hexadecimal instead of decimal in the
          concise tabular display of the charset.

    `full'
          This format requests an extensive display of the charset on
          standard output, using one line per character showing its
          decimal, hexadecimal and octal code values, and also a
          descriptive comment which is indeed the 10646 character name.

     When option `-l' is used together with a CHARSET argument, the
     FORMAT defaults to `decimal'.

`-o'
`--sequence=popen'
     When the recoding requires a combination of two or more elementary
     recoding steps, this option forces the creation of a chain of
     program instances initiated through the `popen(3)' library call,
     all operating in parallel.  In filter mode, costing the overhead
     of multiple program initializations, recoded data will be
     available soon after the program starts, even if many elementary
     recoding steps are required.

     If, at installation time, the `popen(3)' call is said to be
     unavailable, selecting option `-o' is equivalent to selecting
     option `-i'.

`-p'
`--sequence=pipe'
     When the recoding requires a combination of two or more elementary
     recoding steps, this option forces the program to fork itself into
     a few copies interconnected with pipes, using the `pipe(2)' system
     call.  All copies of the program operate in parallel.  This method
     is similar to the method used through option `-o', but is more
     efficient because the program initializes only once.  This is the
     default behavior in filter mode.  If this option is used when
     files are recoded over themselves, this should also save disk
     space because some temporary files might not be needed, at cost of
     more system overhead.

     If, at installation time, the `pipe(2)' call is said to be
     unavailable, selecting option `-p' is equivalent to selecting
     option `-o'.  If both `pipe(2)' and `popen(3)' are unavailable,
     selecting option `-p' is equivalent to selecting option `-i'.

`-q'
`--quiet'
`--silent'
     This option has the sole purpose of inhibiting diagnostic messages
     about irreversible recodings.

     This option is set automatically for the children processes, when
     recode splits itself in many collaborating copies.  Doing so, the
     diagnostic is issued only once by the parent.  See options `-o'
     and `-p'.

`-s'
`--strict'
     By using this option, the user requests that `recode' be very
     strict while recoding a file, merely loosing in the transformation
     any character which is not explicitly mapped from a charset to
     another.  This option renders the recoding less likely reversible,
     so it also implies option `-f'.  Also *Note Reversibility::.

`-t'
`--touch'
     The *touch* option is meaningful only when files are recoded over
     themselves.  Without it, the time-stamps associated with files are
     preserved, to reflect the fact that changing the code of a file
     does not really alter its informational contents.  When the user
     wants the recoded files to be time-stamped at the recoding time,
     this option inhibits the automatic protection of the time-stamps.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Before doing any recoding, the program will first print on `stderr'
     the list of all intermediate charsets planned for recoding,
     starting with the BEFORE charset and ending with the AFTER charset.
     It also prints an indication of the recoding quality, as one of
     the word `reversible', `one to one', `one to many', `many to one'
     or `many to many'.

     This information will appear once or twice.  It is shown a second
     time only when the optimization and step merging phase succeeds in
     creating a new single step.

     This option also has a second effect.  The program will print on
     `stderr' one message per FILE recoded, so to let the user informed
     of the progress of its command.

     An easy way to know beforehand the sequence or quality of a
     recoding is by using the command such as:

          recode -v BEFORE:AFTER < /dev/null

     using the fact that, *so far* in `recode', an empty input file
     produces an empty output file.

`-x=CHARSET'
`--ignore=CHARSET'
     This option tells the program to ignore any recoding path through
     the specified CHARSET, so disabling any single step using this
     charset as a start or end point.  This may be used when the user
     wants to force `recode' in using an alternate recoding path.

     CHARSET may be abbreviated to any unambiguous prefix.  For
     convenience, the value `.' is an alias for `RFC 1345', so the
     option `-x.' effectively disables *all* RFC 1345 tables at once.

`--help'
     The program merely prints a page of help on standard output, and
     exits without doing any recoding.

`--version'
     The program merely prints its version numbers on standard output,
     and exits without doing anything else.

   The BEFORE:AFTER argument specifies the start charset and the goal
charset.  The allowable values for BEFORE or AFTER are described in the
remainder of this document.  Charsets may have predefined alternate
names, or aliases, which are equally acceptable.

   In the BEFORE:AFTER argument only, a backslash may be used to quote
the next character of a charset name.  This might be useful for
preventing a colon to be mistakenly interpreted as the separator between
BEFORE and AFTER.  Rather, the colon could be omitted, because while
recognizing a charset name or alias, GNU `recode' ignores all
characters besides letters and digits.  There is also no distinction
between upper and lower case.  Charset names or aliases may always be
abbreviated to any unambiguous prefix.

   One or both of the BEFORE or AFTER keywords may be omitted, but the
colon which separates them cannot.  An omitted keyword implies the
usual or default code in usage on the system where this program is
installed.  Usually, this default code is `Latin-1' for UNIX systems or
`IBM-PC' for MS-DOS machines.

Reversibility issues
********************

   Even if GNU `recode' tries hard at keeping the recodings reversible,
you should not develop an unconditional confidence in its ability to do
so.  You *ought* to keep only reasonable expectations about reverse
recodings.  In particular, consider:

   * Most transformations are fully reversible for all inputs, but
     loose this property whenever `-s' is specified.

   * A few transformations are not meant to be reversible, by design.

   * Reversibility sometimes depends on actual file contents and cannot
     be ascertained beforehand, without reading the file.

   * Reversibility is never absolute across successive versions of this
     program.  Even correcting a small bug in a mapping could induce
     slight discrepancies later.

   * Reversibility is easily lost by merging.  This is best explained
     through an example.  If you reversibly recode a file from charset
     `A' to charset `B', then you reversibly recode the result from
     charset `B' to charset `C', you cannot expect to recover the
     original file by merely recoding from charset `C' directly to
     charset `A'.  You will instead have to recode from charset `C'
     back to charset `B', and only then from charset `B' to charset `A'.

   * Faulty files create a particular problem.  Consider an example,
     recoding from `IBM-PC' to `Latin-1'.  End of lines are represented
     as `\r\n' in `IBM-PC' and as `\n' in `Latin-1'.  There is no way
     by which a faulty `IBM-PC' file containing a `\n' not preceded by
     `\r' be translated into a `Latin-1' file, and then back.

   * There is another difficulty arising from code equivalences.  For
     example, in a `LaTeX' charset file, the string `\^\i{}' could be
     recoded back and forth through another charset and become
     `\^{\i}'.  Even if the resulting file is equivalent to the
     original one, it is not identical.

   Unless option `-s' is used, `recode' automatically tries to fill
mappings with invented correspondences, often making them fully
reversible.  This filling is not made at random.  The algorithm tries to
stick to the identity mapping and, when this is not possible, it prefers
generating many small permutation cycles, each involving only a few
codes.

   For example, here is how IBM-PC code 186 gets translated to control-U
in Latin-1.  Control-U is 21.  Code 21 is the IBM-PC section sign,
which is 167 in Latin-1.  `recode' cannot reciprocate 167 to 21,
because 167 is the masculine ordinal indicator on IBM PC's, which is
186 in Latin-1.  Code 186 in IBM PC's has no Latin-1 equivalent; by
assigning back to 21, `recode' closes this short permutation loop.

   As a consequence of this map filling, `recode' may sometimes produce
*funny* characters.  They may look annoying, they are nevertheless
helpful when one changes his/her mind and wants to revert to the prior
recoding.  If you cannot stand these, use option `-s', which asks for a
very strict recoding.

   This map filling sometimes has another surprising consequence.  In
some cases, `recode' seems to copy a file without recoding it.  But in
fact, it does.  As an illuminating example, consider you requested:

     recode l1:us < File-Latin1 > File-ASCII
     cmp File-Latin1 File-ASCII

then `cmp' will not report any difference.  This is quite normal.
Latin-1 gets correctly recoded to ASCII for charsets commonalities
(which are the first 128 characters, in this case).  The remaining last
128 Latin-1 characters have no ASCII correspondent.  Instead of loosing
them, recode elects to map them to unspecified characters of ASCII, so
making the recoding reversible.  The simplest way of achieving this is
merely to keep those last 128 characters unchanged.  The overall effect
is copying the file verbatim.

   If you feel this behavior is too generous and if you do not wish to
care about reversibility, simply use option `-s'.  By doing so,
`recode' will strictly map only those Latin-1 characters which have an
ASCII equivalent, and will merely drop those which do not.  Then, there
is more chance that you will observe a difference between the input and
the output file.

Charsets from RFC 1345
**********************

   In the GNU `recode' distribution, there is a copy of RFC 1345:

     "Character Mnemonics & Character Sets", K. Simonsen, Request for
     Comments no. 1345, Network Working Group, June 1992.

   This document is also available by anonymous ftp at `nic.ddn.mil' in
directory `rfc' as file `rfc1345.txt'.  This report defines many
character mnemonics and character sets.

   GNU `recode' implements most of RFC 1345, however:

  1. It does not recognize 16-bits charsets: `GB_2312-80',

  2. It does not recognize those charsets which combine two characters
     for representing a third: `ANSI_X3.110-1983', `ISO_6937-2-add',
     `T.101-G2', `T.61-8bit', `iso-ir-90' and `videotex-suppl'.

  3. It interprets the charset `isoir91' as `NATS-DANO' (alias
     `iso-ir-9-1'), *not* as `JIS_C6229-1984-a' (alias `iso-ir-91').
     So better avoid using these two alias names.

  4. It interprets the charset `isoir92' as `NATS-DANO-ADD' (alias
     `iso-ir-9-2'), *not* as `JIS_C6229-1984-b' (alias `iso-ir-92').
     So better avoid using these two alias names.

  5. It ignores all about code overloading, but still processes
     correctly the remainder of `dk-us' and `us-dk'.


   Keld Simonsen `keld@dkuug.dk' did most of RFC 1345 himself, with
some funding from Danish Standards and Nordic standards (INSTA) project.
He also did the character set design work, with substantial input from
Olle Jaernefors.  Keld typed in almost all of the tables, some have been
contributed.  A number of people have checked the tables in various
ways.  The RFC lists a number of people who helped.

   Internally, RFC 1345 associates which each character an unambiguous
mnemonic of (usually) one or two characters, taken from ISO 646, a
minimal set of 83 characters.  The charset made up by these mnemonics is
available in `recode' under the name `RFC 1345', with `.' being
accepted as a short alias.

   Even if the mnemonics are unambiguous taken separately, strings made
up by concatenating these mnemonics are ambiguous and cannot be safely
interpreted.  So `recode' only allows converting *to* RFC 1345, never
from it.  However, special machinery in the program allows for
converting *through* RFC 1345, when RFC 1345 is neither the initial nor
the final charset of the conversion sequence.

   Recoding directly to `.' has the main goal of letting the user
examine foreign charsets.  We cannot do much, mechanically, with the
result.  For increased readability, as a matter of convenience, `SP' is
left as a single space and `LF' becomes a newline.

Usual ASCII
===========

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `ASCII'.  In
fact, it's true name is `ANSI_X3.4-1968' as per RFC 1345, accepted
aliases being `ANSI_X3.4-1986', `ASCII', `IBM367', `ISO646-US',
`ISO_646.irv:1991', `US-ASCII', `cp367', `iso-ir-6' and `us'.  The
shortest way of specifying it in `recode' is `us'.

   This documentation used to include ASCII tables.  They have been
removed since `recode' can now recreate these (and a lot of others)
easily:

     recode -lf us                   for commented ASCII
     recode -ld us                   for concise decimal table
     recode -lo us                   for concise octal table
     recode -lh us                   for concise hexadecimal table

ASCII extended by Latin Alphabets
=================================

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `Latin-1'.  In
fact, it's true name is `ISO_8859-1:1987' as per RFC 1345, accepted
aliases being `CP819', `IBM819', `ISO-8859-1', `ISO_8859-1',
`iso-ir-100', `l1' and `Latin-1'.  The shortest way of specifying it in
`recode' is `l1'.

   This charset corresponds to the ISO Latin Alphabet 1.  It is an
eight-bit code which coincides with ASCII for the lower half.

   This documentation used to include Latin-1 tables.  They have been
removed since `recode' can now recreate these (and a lot of others)
easily:

     recode -lf l1                   for commented ISO Latin-1
     recode -ld l1                   for concise decimal table
     recode -lo l1                   for concise octal table
     recode -lh l1                   for concise hexadecimal table

   The following from `lasko@video.dec.com' (Tim Lasko), with no date.

     ISO Latin-1, or more completely ISO Latin Alphabet No 1, is now an
     international standard as of February 1987 (IS 8859, Part 1).  For
     those American USEnet'rs that care, the 8-bit ASCII standard,
     which is essentially the same code, is going through the final
     administrative processes prior to publication.

     ISO Latin-1 (IS 8859/1) is actually one of an entire family of
     eight-bit one-byte character sets, all having ASCII on the left
     hand side, and with varying repertoires on the right hand side:

  1. Latin Alphabet No 1 (caters to Western Europe - now approved).

  2. Latin Alphabet No 2 (caters to Eastern Europe - now approved).

  3. Latin Alphabet No 3 (caters to SE Europe + others - in draft
     ballot).

  4. Latin Alphabet No 4 (caters to Northern Europe - in draft ballot).

  5. Latin-Cyrillic alphabet (right half all Cyrillic - processing
     currently suspended pending USSR input).

  6. Latin-Arabic alphabet (right half all Arabic - now approved).

  7. Latin-Greek alphabet (right half Greek + symbols - in draft
     ballot).

  8. Latin-Hebrew alphabet (right half Hebrew + symbols - proposed).

ASCII 7-bits, BS to overstrike
==============================

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `ASCII-BS',
with `BS' as an acceptable alias.

   The file is straight ASCII, seven bits only.  According to the
definition of ASCII: diacritics are applied by a sequence of three
characters: the letter, one BS, the diacritic mark.  We deviate
slightly from this by exchanging the diacritic mark and the letter so,
on a screen device, the diacritic will disappear and let the letter
alone.  At recognition time, both methods are acceptable.

   The French quotes are coded by the sequences: `< BS "' or `" BS <'
for the opening quote and `> BS "' or `" BS >' for the closing quote.
This artificial convention was inherited in straight `ASCII-BS' from
habits around `Bang-Bang' entry, and is not well known.  But we decided
to stick to it so that `ASCII-BS' charset will not loose French quotes.

   The `ASCII-BS' charset is independent of `ASCII', and different.
The following examples demonstrate this, knowing at advance that `!2'
is the `Bang-Bang' way of representing an `e' with an acute accent.
Compare:

     % echo \!2 | recode -v bang:us | od -bc
     Bang-Bang -> ISO_8859-1:1987 -> RFC 1345 -> ANSI_X3.4-1968 (many to one)
     Simplified to: Bang-Bang -> ISO_8859-1:1987 -> ANSI_X3.4-1968 (many to one)
     0000000 351 012
             351  \n
     0000002

with:

     % echo \!2 | recode -v bang:bs | od -bc
     Bang-Bang -> ISO_8859-1:1987 -> ASCII-BS (many to many)
     0000000 047 010 145 012
               '  \b   e  \n
     0000004

   In the first case, the `e' with an acute accent is merely
transmitted by the `Latin-1:ASCII' mapping, not having a special
recoding rule for it.  In the `Latin-1:ASCII-BS' case, the acute accent
is applied over the `e' with a backspace: diacriticized characters have
special rules.  For the `ASCII-BS' charset, reversibility is still
possible, but there might be difficult cases.

ASCII without diacritics nor underline
======================================

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `flat'.

   This code is ASCII expunged of all diacritics and underlines, as
long as they are applied using three character sequences, with BS in the
middle.  Also, despite slightly unrelated, each control character is
represented by a sequence of two or three graphic characters.  The
newline character, however, keeps its functionality and is not
represented.

   Note that charset `flat' is a terminal charset.  We can convert *to*
`flat', but not *from* it.

EBCDIC code
===========

   This charset is the IBM's external binary coded decimal for
interchange coding.  This is an eight bits code.  The following three
variants were implemented in GNU `recode' independently of RFC 1345:

`EBCDIC'
     GNU `recode' `us:ebcdic' conversion is identical to GNU `dd'
     `ebcdic' conversion, and `recode' `ebcdic:us' conversion is
     identical to GNU `dd' `ascii' conversion.  This charset also
     represents the way Control Data Corporation relates EBCDIC to
     8-bits ASCII.

`EBCDIC-CCC'
     GNU `recode' `us:ebcdic-ccc' or `ebcdic-ccc:us' conversions
     represent the way Concurrent Computer Corporation (formerly Perkin
     Elmer) relates EBCDIC to 8-bits ASCII.

`EBCDIC-IBM'
     GNU `recode' `us:ebcdic-ibm' conversion is *almost* identical to
     GNU `dd' `ibm' conversion.  Given the exact `dd' `ibm' conversion
     table, `recode' once said:

          Codes  91 and 213 both recode to 173
          Codes  93 and 229 both recode to 189
          No character recodes to  74
          No character recodes to 106

     So I arbitrarily chose to recode 213 by 74 and 229 by 106.  This
     makes the `EBCDIC-IBM' recoding reversible, but this is not
     necessarily the best correction.  In any case, I believe GNU `dd'
     should be corrected, and preferably, GNU `dd' and GNU `recode'
     should agree on the same correction.  So, this table may change
     once again.

   RFC 1345 brings in `recode' 15 other EBCDIC charsets, and 21 other
charsets having EBCDIC in at least one of their alias names.  You can
get a list of all these by executing:

     recode -l | grep ebcdic

   The file is using Unisys' Icon way to represent diacritics with code
25 escape sequences, under the system QNX.  This is a seven-bit code,

ASCII 6/12 from NOS
===================

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `CDC-NOS', with
`NOS' as an acceptable alias.

   This is one of the charset in use on CDC Cyber NOS systems to
represent ASCII, sometimes named "NOS 6/12" code for coding ASCII.
This code is also known as "caret ASCII".  It is based on a six bits
character set in which small letters and control characters are coded
using a `^' escape and, sometimes, a `@' escape.

   The routines given here presume that the six bits code is already
expressed in ASCII by the communication channel, with embedded ASCII
`^' and `@' escapes.

   Here is a table showing which characters are being used to encode
each ASCII character.

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `Bang-Bang'.

   This is the local code in use on Cybers at Universite de Montreal,
which grave and serious people there prefer to name "ASCII code
display".  This code is also known as "Bang-bang".  It is based on a
six bits character set in which capitals, French diacritics and a few
others are coded using an `!' escape followed by a single character, and
control characters using a double `!' escape followed by a single
character.

   The routines given here presume that the six bits code is already
expressed in ASCII by the communication channel, with embedded ASCII `!'
escapes.

Atari ST code
=============

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `AtariST'.

   This is the character set used on the Atari ST/TT/Falcon.  This is
similar to `IBM-PC', but differs in some details (includes some more
accented characters, the graphic characters are mostly replaced by
hebrew characters, and there is a true German sharp s different from
Greek beta).

   About the end-of-line conversions: the canonical end-of-line on the
Atari is `\r\n', but unlike `IBM-PC', the OS makes no difference
between text and binary input/output; it is up to the application how
to interpret the data.  In fact, most of the libraries that come with
compilers can grok both `\r\n' and `\n' as end of lines.  Many of the
users who also have access to Unix systems prefer `\n' to ease porting
Unix utilities.  So, for easing reversibility, `recode' tries to let
`\r' undisturbed through recodings.

shuffled them around a little bit (for some unknown reason).

Some other charsets
*******************

   Even if these charsets were originally added to `recode' for
handling texts written in French, they find other uses.  We did use them
lot for writing French diacriticized texts in the past, so `recode'
knows how to handle these particularly well for French texts.

ASCII with LaTeX codes
======================

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `LaTeX' and has
`ltex' as an alias.  It is used for ASCII files coded to be read by
LaTeX or, in certain cases, by TeX.

   Whenever you recode from another charset to `LaTeX', beware that all
occurrences of backslashes `\' are usually translated into the string
`\backslash{}'.  However, in practice, people often use backslashes in
the other charset for introducing TeX commands, compromising it: it is
not pure TeX, nor it is pure other charset.  This translation of
backslashes into `\backslash{}' can be rather inconvenient, it may be
inhibited through the command option `-d'.

ASCII with easy French conventions
==================================

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `Texte' and has
`txte' for an alias.

   This charset is a seven bits code, identical to `ASCII-BS', save for
French diacritics which are noted using a slightly different convention.

   At text entry time, these conventions provide a little speed up.  At
read time, they slightly improve the readability over a few alternate
ways of coding diacritics.  Of course, it would better to have a
specialized keyboard to make direct eight bits entries and fonts for
immediately displaying eight bit ISO Latin-1 characters.  But not
everybody is so fortunate.  In several mailing environments, the eight
bit is often willingfully destroyed.

   Easy French has been in use in France for a while.  I only slightly
adapted it (the diaeresis option) to make it more comfortable to several
usages in Qu'ebec originating from Universit'e de Montr'eal.  In fact,
the main problem for me was not to necessarily to invent Easy French,
but to recognize the "best" convention to use, (best is not being
defined, here) and to try to solve the main pitfalls associated with
the selected convention.

Diacritics
----------

   French quotes (sometimes called "angle quotes") are noted the same
way English quotes are noted in TeX, *id est* by ```' and `'''.

   No effort has been put to preserve Latin ligatures (`ae', `oe')
which are representable in several other charsets.  So, these ligatures
may be lost through Easy French conventions.

   This is almost the French convention for simplified diacritics entry:

`e''
     Acute accent

`e`'
     Grave accent

`e^'
     Circumflex accent

`e"'
     Diaeresis

`c,'
     Cedilla

   In some countries, `:' is used instead of `"' to mark diaeresis.
`recode' support one convention on a single call, depending on the `-c'
option of the `recode' command.

   The convention is prone to loosing information, because the diacritic
meaning overloads some characters that already have other uses.  To
alleviate this, some knowledge of the French language is boosted into
the recognition routines.  So, the following subtleties are
systematically obeyed by the various recognizers.

   * A single quote which follows a `e' does not necessarily means an
     acute accent if it is followed by a single other one.  For example:

    `e''
          will give an `e' with an acute accent.

    `e'''
          will give a simple `e', with a closing quotation mark.

    `e''''
          will give an `e' with an acute accent, followed by a closing
          quotation mark.

     There is a problem induced by this convention if there are English
     quotations with a French text.  In sentences like:

          There's a meeting at Archie's restaurant.

     the single quotes will be mistaken twice for acute accents.  So
     English contractions and suffix possessives could be mangled.

   * A double quote or colon, depending on `-c' option, which follows a
     vowel is interpreted as diaeresis only if it is followed by another
     letter.  But there are in French several words that *end* with a
     diaeresis, the program also recognizes them.  *Note Ending
     diaeresis::, for a study of all the problematic cases.

   * A comma which follows a `c' is interpreted as a cedilla only if it
     is followed by one of the vowels `a', `o' and `u'.

List of words ending with diaeresis
-----------------------------------

   Here is a classification of all cases of a diaeresis at the end of a
French word:

   * Words ending in "igue"

        - Feminine words without a relative masculine: `besaigue"' and
          `cigue"'.

        - Feminine words with a relative masculine (1): `aigue"',
          `ambigue"', `contigue"', `exigue"', `subaigue"' and
          `suraigue"'.

   * Words not ending in "igue"

        - Ended by "i" (2): `ai"', `congai"', `goi"', `hai"kai"',
          `inoui"', `sai"', `samurai"', `thai"' and `tokai"'.

        - Ended by "e": `canoe"'.

        - Ended by "u" (3): `Esau"'.

   Notes:

  1. There are supposed to be seven words in this case.  So, one is
     missing.

  2. Look at one of the following sentences (the second has to be
     interpreted with the `-c' option):

          "Ai"e!  Voici le proble`me que j'ai"
          Ai:e!  Voici le proble`me que j'ai:

     There is an ambiguity between an `ai"', the small animal, and the
     indicative future of *avoir* (first person singular), when followed
     by what could be a diaeresis mark.  Hopefully, the case is solved
     by the fact that an apostrophe always precedes the verb and almost
     never the animal.

  3. I did not pay attention to proper nouns, but this one showed up as
     being fairly evident.


   Just to complete this topic, note that it would be wrong to make a
rule for all words ending in "igue" as needing a diaerisis.  Here are
counter-examples: `becfigue', `be`sigue', `bigue', `bordigue',
`bourdigue', `brigue', `contre-digue', `digue', `d'intrigue',
`fatigue', `figue', `garrigue', `gigue', `igue', `intrigue', `ligue',
`prodigue', `sarigue' and `zigue'.

World Wide Web representations
==============================

   This charset is available in `recode' under the name `HTML' and has
`w3' and `WWW' for aliases.

   HTML texts used by World Wide Web limit themselves to 7-bit
characters internally, special sequences beginning with an ampersand
`&' and ending with a semicolon `;' are used for representing characters
from Latin-1 having the 8th bit set.

   When you recode from another charset to `HTML', beware that all
occurrences of ampersands are usually translated into the string
`&amp;', similarly, left angle brackets `<' are translated into `&lt;'
and right angle brackets `>' are translated into `&gt;'.  However, in
practice, people often use ampersands and angle brackets in the other
charset for introducing HTML commands, compromising it: it is not pure
HTML, not it is pure other charset.  These three translations can be
rather inconvenient, they may be specifically inhibited through the
command option `-d'.

Internal aspects
****************

   Suppose that four elementary steps are selected at path optimization
time.  Then `recode' will split itself into four different tasks
interconnected with pipes, logically equivalent to:

     STEP1 <INPUT | STEP2 | STEP3 | STEP4 >OUTPUT

Overall organization
====================

   The main driver constructs, while initializing all conversion
modules, a table giving all the conversion routines available ("single
step"s) and for each, the starting charset and the ending charset.  If
we consider these charsets as being the nodes of a directed graph, each
single step may be considered as oriented arc from one node to the
other.  A cost is attributed to each arc: for example, a high penalty
is given to single steps which are prone to loosing characters, a low
penalty is given to those which need studying more than one input
character for producing an output character, etc.

   Given a starting code and a goal code, `recode' computes the most
economical route through the elementary recodings, that is, the best
sequence of conversions that will transform the input charset into the
final charset.  To speed up execution, `recode' looks for subsequences
of conversions which are simple enough to be merged, it then
dynamically creates new single steps for these mergings.

   A "double step" is a sequence of two single steps, the output of the
first being the special charset `rfc1345', the input of the second
single step being also `rfc1345'.  A special machinery dynamically
produces efficient, reversible, merge-able single steps out of these
double steps.

   The main part of `recode' is written in C, as are most single steps.
A few single steps need to recognize sequences of multiple characters,
they are often better written in `flex'.

Adding new charsets
===================

   It is easy for a programmer to add a new charset to `recode'.  All
it requires is making a few functions kept in a single `.c' file,
adjusting `Makefile.in', and remaking `recode'.

   One of the function should convert from any previous charset to the
new one.  Any previous charset will do, but try to select it so you
will not loose too much information while converting.  The other
function should convert from the new charset to any older one.  You do
not have to select the same old charset than what you selected for the
previous routine.  Once again, select any charset for which you will
not loose too much information while converting.

   If, for any of these two functions, you have to read multiple bytes
of the old charset before recognizing the character to produce, you
might prefer programming it in `flex' in a separate `.l' file.
Prototype your C or `flex' files after one of those which exist
already, so to keep the sources uniform.  Besides, at `make' time, all
`.l' files are automatically merged into a single big one by the script
`mergelex.awk', which requires sources to follow some rules.  Mimetism
is a simple approach which relieves me of explaining all these rules!

   Each of your source files should have its own initialization
function, named `module_CHARSET', which is meant to be executed
quickly, once, prior to any recoding.  It should declare the name of
your charsets and the single steps (or elementary recodings) you
provide, by calling `declare_step' one or more times.  Besides the
charset names, `declare_step' expects a description of the recoding
quality (see `recode.h') and two functions you also provide.

   The first such function has the purpose of allocating structures,
preconditioning conversion tables, etc.  It is also the usual way of
further modifying the `STEP' structure.  This function is executed only
if and when the single step is retained in an actual recoding sequence.
If you do not need such delayed initialization, merely use `NULL' for
the function argument.

   The second function executes the elementary recoding on a whole file.
There are a few cases when you can spare writing this function:

   * Some single steps do nothing else than a pure copy of the input
     onto the output, in this case, you can use the predefined function
     `file_one_to_one', while having a delayed initialization for
     presetting the `STEP' field `one_to_one' to the predefined value
     `one_to_same'.

   * Some single steps are driven by a table which recodes one
     character into another; if the recoding does nothing else, you can
     use the predefined function `file_one_to_one', while having a
     delayed initialization for presetting the `STEP' field
     `one_to_one' with your table.

   * Some single steps are driven by a table which recodes one
     character into a string; if the recoding does nothing else, you
     can use the predefined function `file_one_to_many', while having a
     delayed initialization for presetting the `STEP' field
     `one_to_many' with your table.

   If you have a recoding table handy in a suitable format but do not
use one of the predefined recoding functions, it is still a good idea
to use a delayed initialization to save it anyway, because `recode'
option `-h' will take advantage of this information when available.

   Finally, edit `Makefile.in' to add the source file name of your
routines to the `C_STEPS' or `L_STEPS' macro definition, depending on
the fact your routines is written in C or in `flex'.  For C files only,
also modify the `STEPOBJS' macro definition.
