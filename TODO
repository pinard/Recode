TODO file for GNU recode

Tell <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca> if you feel like volunteering for any
of these ideas, listed more or less in decreasing order of priority.

* Mechanics
  - Get a single distribution, even for MSDOS.
  - Intercept signals to cleanup the temporary files in any event.
  - Revise --sequence=pipe thoroughly.
  - Rewrite execute_pipe_sequence for having only one child per parent.
  - Revise --force thoroughly.
  - Rewrite .l converses for lat1{asci,ltex,txte}, for --force.
  - Optimize/merge all one-to-many cases.
  - Write a better `make check', not as partial and forgiving.
  - Modify recode so I can get rid of diacrit.[ch] (elsewhere).
  - Have -l know which output charset to use (Martin Maechler, 93-12-07).
  - Take note that ->RFC1345 recodings are non reversible.

* Charsets
  - Integrate -c and -g into charsets.
  - `recode -g ibmpc:ibmpc' is not that trivial, find something.
  - Clean up applemac vs macintosh and ibmpc vs ibm437.
  - Implement RFC1345 more fully.
  - Generalize older charsets (latex, texte, etc.) to RFC 1345 mnemonics.
  - Support VT320 support and related character sets.  (Alain Simon)
  - Support @code{[nt]roff} diacritics.
  - Support Universite de Montreal ``accent'' convention.
